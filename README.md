# fitbit
A management and social layer atop FitBit

The first goal is to automate equality across different people goals, by
automating goal management (adjusting peoples goals automatically based on
performance).

The second goal is to increase the social aspect of FitBit competition, beyond
what is possible with the FitBit app (e.g., Challenges) itself.
